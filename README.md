# Sales Order Management Analytics & Reporting system

## Project Overview

This project is about analysing a sales order management database using SQL. The goal was to turn raw sales order data into useful reports and insights for the business. I worked on cleaning and organising the data into usable tables.

The raw data came from two different source systems:
* ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) containing order, product, store products, sales, shipment details
* POS (Point of sales) containing order, product, store products, sales, shipment details
* Explore sales and customer data (EDA).
* Build views that acts as ready-made reports for stakeholders.
* Write stored procedures to answer repeated business questions.
* Analyse trends in sales, customers, products, stores, and deliveries.
  
This project is designed like a real business reporting system where managers and team can track performance and make better decisions.
