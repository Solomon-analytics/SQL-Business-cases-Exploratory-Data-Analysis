# Sales Order Management Analytics & Reporting system

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail Order Management Database. The dataset captures business processes across Sales, Products, Customers, Stores, Shipments, and Sales Representatives.

The analysis leverages SQL (MYSQL) to uncover sales trends, customer behaviour, product performance, store contribution to sales, and shipment efficiency.
It provides business stakeholders with actionable insights into revenue performance, fulfillment operations, customer segmentation, and overall business growth.

## Project Objective

The main objective of this analysis is to:

* Understand how sales and orders evolve over time (yearly & monthly).
* Measure net revenue, order cancellations, order returns, and fulfillment performance.
* Identify top-performing products, stores, and sales reps.
* Segment customers into tiers and churn risk categories.
* Provide performance benchmarks (against averages, targets values)
* Quantify part-to-whole contributions (e.g., category contribution to total sales).
Ultimately, the project builds a data foundation for business stakeholders to monitor KPIs, optimise sales strategies, and improve decision-making.
