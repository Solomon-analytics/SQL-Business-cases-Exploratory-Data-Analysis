Ah! Got it — so this is a **different project**, focused on **SQL-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) and business case reporting**, not the warehouse project.

For that type of project, your **GitHub documentation** should emphasize:

* The **purpose of the project** (EDA + SQL business cases).
* The **type of datasets** used.
* The **SQL artifacts** included (views, stored procedures, queries).
* The **business questions** the SQL analyses answer.
* Optional **visuals or diagrams** for results.

Here’s a clean **README template** you could use for your EDA SQL project:

# 🔍 SQL Business Cases & Exploratory Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the **SQL Business Cases and EDA Project**!
This repository demonstrates how SQL can be used to explore data, generate insights, and answer real-world business questions. It is designed as a **portfolio project** to showcase SQL skills in **analysis, reporting, and automation**.

---

## 🏗️ Project Overview

This project involves:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Discover patterns, trends, and anomalies in datasets using SQL queries.
* **Business Case Analysis:** Build views, stored procedures, and queries to answer specific business questions.
* **Data Validation & Cleaning:** Identify missing data, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
* **Reporting & KPIs:** Create analytical outputs to support decision-making.

## 📊 Business Questions Addressed

Some of the key business questions analyzed in this project include:

1. **Customer Analysis**

   * Who are the top customers by revenue and quantity purchased?
   * What is each customer’s contribution to overall revenue?
   * Which customers are at risk of churn based on purchase patterns?

2. **Product Performance**

   * Which products are top-selling by revenue and quantity?
   * Which products are underperforming?
   * How do product sales vary month-over-month?

3. **Revenue & Trends**

   * What is the total monthly and yearly revenue?
   * How does revenue distribute across products, customers, or regions?
   * Identify seasonal patterns and anomalies in sales.

## 🧩 SQL Artifacts

### Views

* **Customer Sales Analysis (`vw_customer_sales_analysis`)**
  Consolidates customer-level purchases and KPIs.

* **Product Performance (`vw_product_performance`)**
  Aggregates product-level revenue, quantity, and performance ranking.

* **Monthly Revenue Trends (`vw_monthly_revenue_trends`)**
  Shows revenue patterns over months and years, including contribution percentages.

### Stored Procedures

* **`sp_top_customers`** → Returns top N customers by revenue or quantity.
* **`sp_underperforming_products`** → Returns products performing below a defined threshold.
* **`sp_monthly_sales_summary`** → Summarizes total revenue, orders, and average order values per month.

---

## 📝 Key Features

* Modular SQL queries for reusable analysis.
* Aggregations and window functions to rank and compare performance.
* Conditional metrics for business insights (e.g., churn flags, underperformance flags).
* Ready-to-use stored procedures for dynamic reporting.

If you want, I can **also draft a fully formatted template** with **all sections ready**, including:

* A **table of all views/stored procedures with description, inputs, outputs, and business purpose**.
* Example **queries and sample outputs** for stakeholders to visualize.

Do you want me to do that next?
